# fa-awesome

A simple web component to show font awesome icons. Very limited in functionality, though. 
This element requires Polymer 0.8-rc7 for it to work!

## How to use

Sorry I don't have a component page for it jet. But just have a look at the demo.html for instructions how to use it.


## How to install

Clone this repository or use bower:

bower install fa-awesome --save
